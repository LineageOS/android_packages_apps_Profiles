I don\u0027t understand why but the crash messsage aboved happened with BLUETOOTH_CONNECT.\n\nI\u0027m quite sure it happens if:\n- I\u0027m disconnected from my Pinetime\n- I reboot the phone\n- Bluetooth autoconnect Pinetime and Profiles crash\n\nBTW, If I reboot the phone while Pinetime connected, it does not crash on boot.",
